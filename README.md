## 📝 Best Practices for Writing Prompts

Writing great prompts doesn’t have to be hard! Here are some tips to get started:

1. **Be specific**: The clearer your instructions, the better the AI’s response.

   - 🛑 _“Tell me something about fitness.”_
   - ✅ _“Give me a 4-week strength training plan for beginners with rest days included.”_

2. **Add context**: Let the AI know who it’s talking to or what the task is.

   - 🛑 _“Write a letter.”_
   - ✅ _“Write a formal cover letter for a software engineering role.”_

3. **Test and refine**: Use the prompt yourself and tweak it until it feels just right!
